## Classification: Sepsis Medical Data

### Question / Need:

Sepsis is a severe, and potentially life threatening condition in which a person's blood becomes infected with bacteria, and the body reacts extremely, possibly leading to organ disfunction.

What factors can be used to predict if someone will develop sepsis?

### Data:

I plan to use a kaggle dataset that allows analysis, and contains binary classification of patients with/without sepsis after 6 days.

### Algorithms:
* Classification model with python

### Tools:
* pandas
* sklearn for classification model

### MVP Goal:

An MVP for this project would be a model that can accurately classify if a person will develop sepsis.
