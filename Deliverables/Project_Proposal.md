## Classification: Sepsis Medical Data

### Question / Need:

Sepsis is a severe, and potentially life threatening condition in which a person's blood becomes infected with bacteria, and the body reacts extremely, possibly leading to organ disfunction.

If medical professionals were able to more accurately predict the occurrence of sepsis, they may be able to take stronger measures to appropriately prevent or treat patients at risk of developing sepsis.

What factors can be used to predict if someone will develop sepsis?

### Data:

I plan to use a kaggle dataset that allows analysis, and contains binary classification of patients with/without sepsis after 6 days.

### Algorithms:
* Classification model with python

### Tools:
* pandas
* sklearn for classification model

### MVP Goal:

An MVP for this project would be a model that can accurately classify if a person will develop sepsis.
